line number one I like coconuts and some.. flying.. water fueled UFO

Line number two which is whole a lot better than line one yey

Line number three - last attempt failed because I was trying out pull request with my own account(github1). So when I went ahead to create a pull request with my updated cloned file, GitHub just straight away added the new commits to the main branch without any requests or merging steps which I expected. So this time, I got myself another GitHub account(github2) and lets try so that it seems a stranger is trying to pull the changes to my main.

Line number four - okay I need to change my remote origin to my gitHub2 didn't know that. github just added the changed right away again.

Line number five - last attempt didn't work and seemed I need another brand new terminal with a different user. So here I am in a different mac user with a fresh terminal. 

+aaaaaand while trying that, I just learned about forks in GitHub. I'm so dumb I was trying to save the cloned version of the repository to another GitHub account which is not possible. So here I'm trying with forked version of that repository and I'll try merging with that.
