# practice-Push-Pull
This was basically my journey in getting used to going back and forth between my repository in my local machine and github, and learning concept of branches, remotes, push-and-pulls along with creating a pull request.
I did it using two of my own github accounts seperately to try out every step of using fork and I also learned about cloning repository as I did it.
Every attempts or milestone I moved on I left an additional line in the text file 'file_Zero' recording what I tried or what went wrong.
